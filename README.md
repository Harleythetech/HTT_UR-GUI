# HTT_UR-GUI
School assignment that i did that looked like discord's GUI

This is Project is not affiliated with discord what so ever and that the GUI is only (not supposed to be) inspired by Discord

There are 4 Important Files here all of them are "XML" files 

Side Note: "input_rb.xml" is also the same as per the other xml with these keywords - "rb, round_borders, round_borders2" the only difference is the color which you can find in the "colors.xml"
